<h3>Predict metal occupancies in vivo</h3>

<p>The metal occupancy of cytosolic metal-binding proteins is predicted from the thermodynamic activities of metals in a cell.</p>
<p>These activities (as standard free-energies,&nbsp; Δ<em>G°</em>) have been determined in a bacterial cell
  (Osman <em>et al</em>. (2019) <em>Nat. Chem. Bio.</em> 15: 241–249).</p>
<p>The resulting predictions can:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identify metal-specificity</li>
  <li>Infer mis-metalation</li>
  <li>Reveal erroneous affinity measurements</li>
  <li>Suggest differences between these thermodynamic metal activities and those of the host cell</li>
  <li>Indicate where additional mechanisms (such as molecular interactions) must assist metalation</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To predict the metalation state of a protein or molecule, fill in the values in the table below including as
  many determined metal affinities (activities) as possible.</strong></p>
